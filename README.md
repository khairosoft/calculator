# calculator
A simple calculator written in C with GTK3. 
# Dependencies
1. GNU make.
2. Standard build utilities (gcc). These should be preinstalled on most linux based systems and available in the repos if not.
3. GTK3 (runtime and development packages). For debian/ubuntu based systems this would be the package libgtk-3-dev package (as well as the runtime libgtk-3-0 package).
4. There should be similar packages available in the repos for most linux distros - for arch linux, the gtk package should install everything necessary.
# Install:
Simply run make to compile the program and run it in place with ./calculator.
